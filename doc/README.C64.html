<h1>NETBOOT65 FOR THE C64</h1>

<h2>STARTING THE SERVER</h2>
<ol>
	<li> unzip the archive somewhere on your local hard drive</li>
	<li>start the bin/tftp_server.rb script (e.g. by double-clicking on it)</li>
</ol>

<h2>TO USE WITH VICE</h2>
Run <a href=http://www.viceteam.org/>VICE</a> with the nb65_std_cart.bin cartridge image attached (e.g. "x64.exe -cart8 nb65_std_cart.bin")

<h2>TO USE WITH A REAL C64</h2>
<h3>Option 1 - Hardcore</h3>
	burn the nb65_std_cart.bin cartridge to an EPROM and insert in an 8KB cartridge (which should be set up to have EXROM=0, GAME=1)

<h3>Option 2 - Just dabbling</h3>
You can just run the nb65_c64_ram.prg program (which is essentially the cartridge image plus a loader prg to insert the image into the right place in RAM).

<h2>USING THE CARTRIDGE</h2>

When the cartridge starts, it will attempt to configure the IP stack via DHCP. If the DHCP config fails (either by timing out, or the user press RUN/STOP)
then the IP stack will fall back to using the IP configuration built into the cartridge. See the section "IP CONFIGURATION" for info on how to modify the
cartridge defaults prior to burning an image.
<p>
Once the IP stack is initialised, the "main menu" screen will be displayed. From the main menu, the following options are available:
<ul>
	<li>F1 : TFTP BOOT. THis will query a TFTP server for a list of PRG files, and allow the selection of a file to be downloaded and executed.</li>
	<li>F3 : BASIC. This will exit to BASIC (with IP stack still configured, so NB65 aware apps can be loaded from disk and run)</li>
	<li>F5 : ARP TABLE. This will show a table of the current mapping of IP and MAC addresses </li>
	<li>F7 : CONFIG. This brings up a menu where the IP configuration can be modified. Changes made here will be persistent until the next reboot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>IP CONFIGURATION</h2>
There is a script in the "bin" folder called "set_ip_config.rb" that can be used to modify the MAC address and IP config details in the cart image before
it is burned. For example, to set the MAC address and DNS servers, use this command:
<pre>set_ip_config.rb nb65_std_cart.bin mac ab:cd:ef:12:34:56 dns 10.5.1.1</pre>
run "set_ip_config.rb" with no parameters to see all the options for what can be configured.


<h2>ADDING MORE FILES</h2>

Only single-load files can be used (this may change in a future release). The files need to be in "PRG" format, i.e.the first 2 bytes of the file must be
the load address (little-endian, i.e. low/high). The files also need to have a file extension of ".PRG" (in upper case, if your operating system of choice
is case sensitive).
<p>
Files need to be placed in the 'boot/' folder.
<p>
Due to a limitation in the menu selection code, only the first 128 PRG files in the boot/ folder can be selected.

	
<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<ol>
	<li>RR-NET or compatible adaptor (to use under VICE, you will need pcap or winpcap installed)</li>
	<li>(RECOMMENDED) a DHCP server on your network</li>
	<li>a working ruby installation</li>
