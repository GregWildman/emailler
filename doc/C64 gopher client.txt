C64 gopher browser v0.1


REQUIREMENTS
	1) RR-NET or compatible
	2) DHCP server on LAN

USAGE

When run, the program will use DHCP to assign itself an IP address, default gateway and DNS server address.

You will then be prompted for the address of a gopher server. you can enter a hostname or an ip address. If 
you just hit enter at this prompt,  "gopher.floodgap.com" will load. NB - in the current version you can only
enter a server name, not a specific resource on that server, or a port (the default gopher port 70 is used).

Once a gopher resource is loaded, the following keys are active:

SPACE, F7 or down arrow : scroll down to next page
F1 or up arror		: scroll up to previous page
F2 			: show recently visited resource
F3 or left arrow	: go back to last visited resource
F5			: prompt to enter a new server (nb server name only - not resource or port)
RUN/STOP		: quit

If the page currently being displayed has links to further resources in it, each link will be displayed 
starting with a highlighted letter (e.g. the first link on a page will have an inverse "A" next to it,
the 2nd link on a page will have an inverse "B" next to it etc). Press the letter assigned to the link
will load up that resource.

Currently only Text and Directory resources are handled.
